    "qa_result": "Let's evaluate the Terraform configuration against the provided test cases. Remember, since we're simulating execution, we're relying on the logic within the code and its expected behavior. \n\n**Test Case 1: Positive - Basic Instance Creation**\n\n* **What was tested:**  The ability of the code to create an EC2 instance with valid inputs for AMI ID, instance type, and subnet ID.\n* **Actual Result:**  The code *should* successfully create an instance using the provided variables.\n* **Expected Result:** Terraform successfully creates an EC2 instance.\n* **Test Status:**  **Passed** (Assuming all variables are valid).\n\n**Test Case 2: Negative - Invalid AMI ID**\n\n* **What was tested:** The code's handling of an invalid AMI ID.\n* **Actual Result:** The code *should* raise an error during `terraform apply` due to the invalid AMI ID.\n* **Expected Result:** Terraform throws an error message indicating the AMI ID is invalid.\n* **Test Status:**  **Passed** (Assuming the code correctly validates the AMI ID).\n\n**Test Case 3: Negative - Invalid Subnet ID**\n\n* **What was tested:** The code's handling of an invalid subnet ID.\n* **Actual Result:** The code *should* raise an error during `terraform apply` due to the invalid subnet ID.\n* **Expected Result:** Terraform throws an error message indicating the subnet ID is invalid.\n* **Test Status:**  **Passed** (Assuming the code correctly validates the subnet ID).\n\n**Test Case 4: Edge Case - Default Instance Type**\n\n* **What was tested:** The behavior when no instance type is provided.\n* **Actual Result:** The code *should* use the default instance type \"t2.micro\".\n* **Expected Result:** Terraform creates an instance with the \"t2.micro\" instance type.\n* **Test Status:**  **Passed** (Assuming the default value works as expected).\n\n**Test Case 5: Edge Case - No Subnet ID Specified**\n\n* **What was tested:** The behavior when no subnet ID is provided.\n* **Actual Result:** The code *should* likely fail to create the instance as a subnet ID is required.\n* **Expected Result:** Terraform throws an error message indicating a subnet ID is required.\n* **Test Status:**  **Passed** (Assuming the code enforces the subnet ID requirement).\n\n\n\n**Important Note:** These tests are based on the provided code snippets. To thoroughly test the configuration, you'd need to:\n\n* **Provide Real Values:** Replace placeholders like `ami-0c5b81e4267b26317` and `\"us-west-2\"` with actual values.\n* **Execute Terraform:** Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to observe the actual behavior.\n* **Validate Outputs:** Check the output of `terraform apply` to ensure the created instance matches the expected values.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or want to explore specific aspects of the code in more detail!\n"
