    "code_review": "The code looks good! Here's a breakdown with some suggestions:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Clear Structure:** The code is well-organized with separate files for providers, variables, and resources.\n* **Descriptive Comments:** Comments explain the purpose of each section, making the code easy to understand.\n* **Variable Usage:**  Variables are used effectively to make the configuration flexible and reusable.\n* **Default Values:**  Providing default values for variables is helpful for users who don't need to customize.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n* **AWS Provider Version:** While `~> 4.0` is a reasonable range, consider specifying a more precise version for better control and stability.\n* **Region Specificity:**  Instead of a hardcoded `us-west-2` region, consider making this a variable as well. This allows for easy deployment across different AWS regions.\n* **Security Groups:**  It's crucial to define security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for your instances. Add a variable for the security group ID and include it in the `aws_instance` resource.\n* **Tags:**  Tags are essential for organization and cost tracking. Add a variable for tags and apply them to your instance.\n* **Documentation:** \n    * Consider adding a README file to the project that explains:\n        * The purpose of the Terraform configuration.\n        * How to use the variables.\n        * Any dependencies or prerequisites.\n* **Input Validation:**\n    * Validate the input variables (like `subnet_id`) to ensure they are valid AWS IDs. You can use Terraform's validation features or write custom validation logic.\n\n**Example with Improvements:**\n\n```terraform\n# main.tf\nterraform {\n  required_providers {\n    aws = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/aws\"\n      version = \"4.10.0\" # Use a specific version\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nprovider \"aws\" {\n  region = var.region # Use a variable for region\n}\n\n# ... (rest of your variables)\n\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  ami           = var.os_image_id\n  instance_type = var.instance_type\n  subnet_id      = var.subnet_id\n  security_groups = [var.security_group_id]\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"My-Terraform-Instance\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n"
