    "security_review": "This code has several potential security issues:\n\n**1. Hardcoded AMI:** Using a hardcoded AMI ID (`ami-0c5b6517831d9d96c`) is not recommended.  This makes your infrastructure less flexible and potentially vulnerable if that specific AMI is compromised.\n\n**2. Hardcoded Access:** The code doesn't explicitly define security rules for the EC2 instance. This means it might be exposed to unnecessary network traffic and attacks. \n\n**3. Lack of Password Management:**  There's no mention of how SSH keys are managed for accessing the instance.  This could lead to insecure password practices if not properly addressed.\n\n**4. Limited Variable Scope:**  Variables like `instance_type` and `instance_size` should be scoped appropriately to prevent accidental misconfigurations.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n* **Use a dynamic AMI selection:**\n\nInstead of hardcoding the AMI ID, consider using a Terraform module or a dynamic lookup based on your desired OS version and other criteria.\n\n```terraform\nvariable \"os_version\" {\n  default = \"ubuntu-22.04\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  ami = aws_ami.ubuntu_ami.id\n}\n\nresource \"aws_ami\" \"ubuntu_ami\" {\n  most_recent = true\n  filter {\n    name = \"name\"\n    values = [\"ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-22.04\"]\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n* **Define Security Groups:**  Create dedicated security groups with carefully crafted inbound and outbound rules to control network access.\n\n* **Implement Secure SSH Access:**  Use SSH keys for authentication instead of passwords. Configure the instance to only accept connections from trusted IP addresses.\n\n* **Refine Variable Scope:**  Use modules or other techniques to isolate configuration variables and prevent accidental overrides.\n* **Consider Input Validation:**  Validate user-provided inputs for variables to prevent unexpected or malicious configurations.\n\n\n\n**Revised Code (Partial):**\n\n```terraform\n# ... other configurations ...\n\n# Define Security Group\nresource \"aws_security_group\" \"example\" {\n  name        = \"terraform-example-sg\"\n  description = \"Security group for Terraform example\"\n\n  # Inbound Rules\n  ingress {\n    protocol = \"tcp\"\n    from_port = 22 \n    to_port = 22\n    cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"] # Only allow SSH from anywhere (**IMPORTANT:**  This is for demonstration purposes only. In a production environment, restrict this to trusted IP ranges)\n  }\n\n  # ... more rules as needed ...\n\n  egress { # Allow outbound traffic to the internet\n    from_port = 0\n    to_port = 0\n    protocol = \"-1\"\n    cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]\n  }\n}\n\n# ... other configurations ...\n```\n\n\nRemember to review and adapt these suggestions to your specific needs and security requirements.\n"
