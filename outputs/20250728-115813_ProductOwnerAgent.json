    "po_review": "These user stories are well-written and capture the essence of deploying a Linux VM using Terraform.  Here are my thoughts:\n\n**APPROVED**\n\n* **Story 1:**  Clear, concise, and focuses on the developer's need for quick environment setup.\n* **Story 2:**  Addresses a crucial aspect of VM deployment \u2013 network configuration \u2013 and highlights the benefit of easy connectivity.\n* **Story 3:**  Provides flexibility for developers to choose the specific Linux environment they need.\n* **Story 4:**  Excellent for DevOps, emphasizing standardization and reduced deployment time through templates.\n* **Story 5:**  Prioritizes security by automating security group creation and firewall rule application.\n* **Story 7:**  Addresses the operational need for scalability and resource optimization.\n* **Story 8:**  Essential for data protection and disaster recovery, ensuring automatic VM backups.\n\n**Suggestions**\n\n* **Story 6:**  While monitoring and alerting are important, this story could be more specific. Consider adding details about the type of issues to be monitored (e.g., performance, availability) and the desired alert mechanism (e.g., email, Slack). \n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe user stories provide a strong foundation for building Terraform code to deploy Linux VMs. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to brainstorm any further on Story 6 or other aspects of the project!\n"
