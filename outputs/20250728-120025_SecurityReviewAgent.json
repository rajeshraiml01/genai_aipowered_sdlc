    "security_review": "The code you provided has some potential security issues:\n\n**1. Hardcoded AMI ID:**\n\n   -  The `os_image_id` is hardcoded to a specific AMI ID. This could be problematic if you need to switch to a different AMI in the future. It's better to use a variable or allow the user to specify the AMI ID at runtime.\n\n**2. Missing Security Group:**\n\n   - The code doesn't define any security groups, which are crucial for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to your instances. Without proper security groups, your instance could be vulnerable to attacks.\n\n**3. Potential for Insecure Default Values:**\n\n   - While the `default` values for `instance_type` and `os_image_id` seem reasonable, it's important to review them carefully and ensure they align with your security requirements.  \n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Use Variables for AMI ID:**\n\n   - Instead of hardcoding the AMI ID, make it a variable that can be passed to Terraform during deployment:\n     ```terraform\n     variable \"os_image_id\" {\n       description = \"Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID for the Linux OS\"\n       type        = string\n       # Remove the default value\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Define Security Groups:**\n\n   - Create security groups with specific rules to control network access to your instances. For example, allow SSH access only from your trusted IP addresses.\n   ```terraform\n   resource \"aws_security_group\" \"example\" {\n     name        = \"allow-ssh\"\n     description = \"Allow SSH access from trusted IP\"\n     vpc_id      = aws_vpc.example.id\n\n     ingress {\n       from_port   = 22\n       to_port     = 22\n       protocol    = \"tcp\"\n       cidr_blocks = [\"0.0.0.0/0\"] # Replace with your trusted IP range\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Review Default Values:**\n\n   - Double-check the default values for `instance_type` and other variables to ensure they meet your security standards.\n\n4. **Consider IAM Roles:**\n\n   - Instead of using the root user, use an IAM role to grant your instances the necessary permissions. This helps to limit the potential damage from compromised instances.\n\n\n\n**APPROVAL:** Once these suggestions are implemented, the code will be more secure. \n"
